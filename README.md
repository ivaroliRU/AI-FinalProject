# Final Project
## Machine Learning for cancer prognosis and prediction

### About the project
This is the final project for the course Artificial intelligence in Reykjavík University. This project aims to create a neural network that predicts if tumor cells are malignent or not. The network also has to be easily accessible by an api.

### Why?
Most people know someone who has suffered or is suffering from cancer. A key role of lowering
mortality rates in cancer patients is diagnosing the patient and treating him early on. According
to a healthcare worker from Selfoss it takes about 3 weeks to diagnose cancer but can take up to
5 weeks. First the patient has to get an appointment (which takes about a week) then the doctor
has to get tissue sample and an MRI scan before he can diagnose the patient. This process can
obviously be optimized with the use of AI and be shortened, leading to higher survival rates of
cancer patients.
